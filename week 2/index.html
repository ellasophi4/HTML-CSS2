    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like how if you put the sauce before the base it is messed up?</h3>
    <h4>Or if you do the cheese before the sauce?</h4>

    <p>
        Making a pizza is a lot like coding as there is a specific
        order in which you have to things. I can't be bothered to write
        the rest of this copy but it doesn't matter.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the base</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Add the toppings</li>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <li>Cut</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>The toppings are different and have no specific order</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Caramelised <em>Onion</em></li>
        <li>Red <strong>Peppers</strong></li>
        <li>Olives</li>
    </ul>
